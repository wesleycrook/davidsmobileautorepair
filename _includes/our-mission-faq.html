                    <h4>Can I buy the parts myself?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>I typically purchase the parts, as I often am able to get the highest quality, with the fastest delivery, for the best price. However, I'm happy to let customers purchase their own parts if they choose to do so. If you'd like me to consult on the particular brand/vendor of the parts, I can help.</p>

                    <h4>What methods of payment do you accept?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>We offer online invoicing using PayPal, and will accept any major Visa, Mastercard, debit, or credit cards. Our mininum service call is $45. We use electronic invoicing, so you can conveniently receive and pay for your repair from your phone or mobile device.</p>

                    <h4>Does the $45 charge count towards the repair?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>Most mechanic's costing isn't transparent enough to see it, but they're all charging for the time (labor) that they spend working on your vehicle. The $45 service call pays for the time I spend doing the diagnostic (investigating the problem with your vehicle) and will often get me started on the time to do the repair. The service call fee ensures that the value I bring (by diagnosing your vehicle's problem) is covered, even if you choose to let someone else do the repair that I recommend.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I have a tremendous amound of experience working on older (pre-1983 "classic" carburated) vehicles as well as newer vehicles.</p>

                    <h4>Someone else already worked on it, but couldn't fix it. Can you help me?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>I have the experience needed to get the job done right, the first time. Give me a call, and I'll help you clean up the mess. Once I've fixed it, I'll aim to be your first call any time you need help in the future.</p>
