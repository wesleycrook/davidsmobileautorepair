                    <h4>Can I buy the parts myself?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>I typically purchase the parts, as I often am able to get the highest quality, with the fastest delivery, for the best price. However, I'm happy to let customers purchase their own parts if they choose to do so. If you'd like me to consult on the particular brand/vendor of the parts, I can help. Please understand there is NO warranty on customer supplied parts. Occasionally, substandard parts can fail within 1-hour to 1-year, so it's important to know that I cannot offer any warranty on the life of any parts that you provide. I'll do an excellent job either way, and if you'd like the peace of mind of a warranty, allow me to do the legwork on getting the parts for you.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We offer online invoicing using FreshBooks, and will accept any major Visa, Mastercard, debit, or credit cards. <strong>Our mininum service call is $45</strong>.

                    <h4>Does the $45 charge count towards the repair?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>The service call charge of $45 is a minimum for the service technician to come to you home or business. Typically, I'm able to then find the problem with your vehicle within 15 minutes, and give you an accurate estimate on the needed repair. A diagnostic charge may be needed for anything over 15 minutes of checking your vehicle concerning the fault you've described.</p>
