                    <h4>Can I buy the parts myself?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>I typically purchase the parts, as I am able to get the highest quality, with the fastest delivery, for the best price. Allow me to provide the peace of mind with excellent, warrantied parts by doing the legwork on getting the parts for you.</p>

                <p>We offer online invoicing using FreshBooks, and will accept any major Visa, Mastercard, debit, or credit cards. <strong>Our minimum service call is $45</strong>.

                    <h4>Does the $45 charge count towards the repair?</h4>
                </div>
                <p>The service call charge of $45 is a minimum for the service technician to come to you home or business. Typically, I'm able to then find the problem with your vehicle within 15 minutes, and give you an accurate estimate on the needed repair. A diagnostic charge may be needed for anything over 15 minutes of checking your vehicle concerning the fault you've described.</p>

                <p>I have the experience needed to get the job done right, the first time. Give me a call, and I'll help you clean up the mess. Once I've fixed it, I'll aim to be your first call any time you need help in the future.</p>
